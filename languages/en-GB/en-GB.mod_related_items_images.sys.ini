MOD_RELATED_ITEMS_IMAGES="Art√≠culos - Related with images"
MOD_RELATED_ITEMS_IMAGES_XML_DESCRIPTION="This module displays other Articles with images that are related to the one currently being viewed. These relations are established by the Meta keywords. <br />All the keywords of the current Article are searched against all the keywords of all other published Articles. For example, you may have an Article on &quot;Breeding Parrots&quot; and another on &quot;Hand Raising Black Cockatoos&quot;. If you include the keyword &quot;parrot&quot; in both Articles, then the Related Items Module will list the &quot;Breeding Parrots&quot; Article when viewing &quot;Hand Raising Black Cockatoos&quot; and vice-versa."
